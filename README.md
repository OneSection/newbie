# Newbie
Repository for your first Pull Request ðŸ¥‡

## âœ… Requirements
OneSection is an inclusive community and is open for **everyone**. But this project is specifically for first time contributers. Please choose another project to contribute if you are not contributing to an open source project for the first time. Thank you.

> Right now, this is the only repository you can contribute to but we'll soon add more projects so that you can contribute to more advance projects.

## ðŸš€ Get Started
Before getting started, you should have: 
- [git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, install it from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
- a GitHub account. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for one if you don't have.

### How to Contribute?
1. **Fork this project repository** - Clik on the fork button (top-right corner of this page) and it will create a copy of this repository on your GitHub account.

Now you'll see that a fork has been created under your account.

Using git, you can now clone your fork on your computer using the command:

```bash
git clone URL_OF_YOUR_FORK
```
For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushSaini00/newbie.git
```

This will create a copy of the repository from GitHub to your computer inside a subdirectory of your working directory. The folder will have the same name as your git repository.

3. **Open your local repository in a Code Editor** - You can use any code editor of your choice but if you're looking for one, I would recommand you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
