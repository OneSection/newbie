# Newbie - OneSection
Repository for your first Pull Request. 

This repository is divided into different folder, and each folder is a separate project. You can choose to contribute to only one of the listed projects.

## ✅ Requirements
OneSection is an inclusive community and is open for **everyone**. But this project is specifically for first time contributers, so if you're not a first timer, please contribute to another Project.

> Right now, this is the only repository you can contribute to but we'll soon add more projects so that you can contribute to more advance projects.

## 🚀 Get Started
Before getting started, you should have: 
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, install it from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
- a GitHub account. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for one if you don't have.

### How to Contribute?
1. **Fork this project repository** - Clik on the fork button (top-right corner of this page) and it will create a copy of this repository on your GitHub account.

Now you'll see that a fork has been created under your account.

2. **Clone the fork** - Clik the green clone button and copy to URL.

Using git, you can now clone your fork on your computer using the command:

```bash
git clone URL_OF_YOUR_FORK
```
For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushSaini00/newbie.git
```

This will create a copy of the repository from GitHub to your computer inside a subdirectory of your working directory. The folder will have the same name as your git repository.

3. **Open your local repository in a Code Editor** - You can use any code editor of your choice but if you're looking for one, I would recommand you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
